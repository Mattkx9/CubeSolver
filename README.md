# CubeSolver
Program designed to find the solution to any 3x3 Rubik's Cube scramble with a minimal move count.

## Goals
1. Create virtual cube capable of doing any quarter turn (exluding slice layer turns and wide turns).
2. Construct a user-friendly UI that offers features such as:
- Scramble input
- Solve statistics
- Debugging information
3. And lastly, an algorithm that finds the solution to any scrambled Rubik's Cube in a minimal amount of moves.

## Time Frame
First stable release date is set to be in Fall 2018.

Note: This isn't the first time a program like this has been invented. It's a personal programming challenge for myself designed to be used in tandem with a robotic project to come later.
